Optimization Strategies in Connective Field Mapping
##################################################################

Benchmarks for different modelling procedures in cortical connective field (CF) mapping.
========================================================================================



Here we compare three flavors of population cortico-cortical connective field (CF) modeling. First, the former implementation in ``mrVista`` (using Matlab's ``lscov``) :footcite:p:`Haak_2013,Gravel_2014`, which implemented a grid search approach. Without further optimization, the parameter space revealed by this implementation match predefined grid value predictions. Second, the implementation part of the *connective field* branch of the `prfpy <https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/prfpy>`_ Python package :footcite:p:`Knapen_topo_2021`. Using Python scikit-learn optimization functions (implemented as part of the ``prfpy`` package), the parameter space this package provides also converges to predefined grid parameters, although at a much faster rate (thanks to the CPU parallelization tool `joblib``). Third, a more recent Python implementation by So-Hyeon et al. (2024) :footcite:p:`Yoo_proto_2024` that implements a parameter (CF size) refinement approach using the `Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm>`_ optimization algorithm. Fourth, another Python implementation that capitalizes on `automatic differentiation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation>`_ using ``TensorFlow`` and CUDA (partly inspired in the recent Python package `braincoder <https://braincoder-devs.github.io/>`_) :footcite:p:`deHollander2024braincoder` to achieve highly efficient gradient descent. To coordinate this effort, we rely on widely used population receptive field mapping tools :footcite:p:`Dumoulin_2008,Benson_2018` and high-field 7T-MRI data kindly made available by `NeuroSpin <https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin.aspx>`_.
