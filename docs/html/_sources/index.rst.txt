Optimization Strategies in Connective Field Mapping
##################################################################

Benchmarks for different modelling procedures in cortical connective field (CF) mapping.
========================================================================================



Here we compare three flavors of population cortico-cortical connective field (CF) modeling. First, the former implementation in ``mrVista`` (using Matlab's ``lscov``) :footcite:p:`Haak_2013,Gravel_2014`, which implemented a grid search approach. Without further optimization, the parameter space revealed by this implementation match predefined grid value predictions. Second, the implementation part of the *connective field* branch of the `prfpy <https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/prfpy>`_ Python package :footcite:p:`Knapen_topo_2021`. Using Python scikit-learn optimization functions (implemented as part of the ``prfpy`` package), the parameter space ``prfpy`` provides also converge to predefined grid, although at a much faster rate (thanks to the CPU parallelization tool `joblib``). Third, a custom version of more recent CF modelling approach (by So-Hyeon et al. (2024) :footcite:p:`Yoo_proto_2024`) that implements a *derivative-free* parameter (CF size) refinement approach (`see here <https://nicogravel.github.io/cfMaps/html/cfmap.html#cfmap.CF_mapping.optimize_connfield_dfree>`_). Fourth, our custom Python implementation of *automatic differentiation* -powered `gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent>`_ using ``TensorFlow`` and CUDA (partly inspired in the recent Python package `braincoder <https://braincoder-devs.github.io/>`_) :footcite:p:`deHollander2024braincoder` to achieve highly efficient gradient descent (`see here <https://nicogravel.github.io/cfMaps/html/cfmap.html#cfmap.CF_mapping.optimize_connfield_gdescent>`_ and `here <https://nicogravel.github.io/cfMaps/html/cfmap.html#cfmap.CF_mapping.optimize_connfield_joint>`_ for a joint optimization approach that optmimzed both CF size and position). To coordinate this effort, we rely on widely used population receptive field mapping tools :footcite:p:`Dumoulin_2008,Benson_2018` and high-field 7T-MRI retinotopy data kindly made available by `NeuroSpin <https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin.aspx>`_.
