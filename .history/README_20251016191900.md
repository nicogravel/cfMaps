# Optimization strategies in cortical connective field (CF) mapping

Benchmarks for different modelling procedures in cortical connective field (CF) mapping.

modeling. First, the former implementation in `mrVista` (using Matlab's `lscov`){cite:p}`Haak_2013, Gravel_2014`, which implemented a grid search approach. Without further optimization, the parameter space revealed by this implementation match predefined grid value predictions. Second, the implementation part of the *connective field* branch of the [prfpy](https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/prfpy) Python package {cite:p}`Knapen_topo_2021`. Using Python sci-kit learn optimization functions (implemented as part of the `prfpy` package), the parameter space this version provides also converges to predefined grid parameters. Third, a more recent Python implementation by So-Hyeon et al. (2024){cite:p}`Yoo_proto_2024` that implements a parameter refinement space using the [Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm) optimization algorithm for gradient descent using sci-py functions. Fourth, another Python implementation that capitalizes on [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) using `TensorFlow` and CUDA (partly inspired in the recent Python package [braincoder](https://braincoder-devs.github.io/)) {cite:p}`deHollander2024braincoder` to achieve highly efficient gradient descent. Too coordinate this effort, we rely on widely population receptive field mapping tools {cite:p}`Dumoulin_2008,Benson_2018`.
